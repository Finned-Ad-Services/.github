### Sports betting, smarter.
## The all-in-one AI platform for informed sports betting
> FinnedAI offers a comprehensive analytics platform to help sports bettors make more informed and possible choices. We acknowledge that our platform couldn't exist without various open-source packages our platform relies on, so we work to give back to the community with our own contributions. Apart from the sports sector, we have published several fintech related works which can be found in our repositories.

### Finned-tech and generative AI
## Explaining the FinnedGPT software
> Outside of the traditional offering of straight picks on our platform, we also developed the FinnedGPT platform, a chatbot finetuned on 10 years of proprietary analysis, meetrics, and player statistics. If not for the great work of OpenAI with the GPT models, much of which is open source, and the amazing MindsDB platform on GitHub, this advancement into accessible betting could not have been made. For this, we thank these organizations and the wider open-source community.
